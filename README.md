## 🧑‍💻 About Me

With over **15 years of experience** working on fast-growing products, I’ve come to understand the real pains of product owners and the vulnerable points in flexible development.

Beyond coding, I focus on:
- **Leading development teams**
- **Improving workflow and team communication**
- **Bridging gaps between different departments and development teams**

I'm also deeply invested in **product growth**. I:
- Regularly check **user feedback and analytics**
- Continuously assess and enhance **UI/UX**
- Always strive to align development with **current product needs**

### 📈 Results in every product I worked on:
- **Zero** missed release deadlines within **three months** of joining a team  
- Improved **user work efficiency by 20%+** through UX enhancements  
- Increased **crash-free users to 99%**
